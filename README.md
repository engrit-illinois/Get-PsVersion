# Summary
A quick and dirty PowerShell function to get the PowerShell version of a remote machine.  

For some reason it seems that remotely retrieving this info is WAY harder than it should be. You'd think there would just be a cmdlet for it.  

# Usage
1. Copy the function into a PowerShell prompt.
2. Run it: e.g.: `Get-PsVersion "computer-name"`
